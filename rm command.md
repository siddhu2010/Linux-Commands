rm command

rm is a command-line utility for removing files and directories. It is one of the essential commands that every Linux user should be familiar with.

Syntax :
   rm [OPTIONS]... FILE...
 
 Option
   -i : The -i option tells rm to prompt the user for each given file before removing it

   -r : To remove non-empty directories and all the files within them recursively, use the -r.
   
   -f : rm prompts for confirmation removal if a file is write protected. The -f option overrides this minor protection and removes the file forcefully.
